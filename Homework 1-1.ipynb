    "Big data analytics often requires (1) importing data from multiple sources, possibly extracting content from text; then (2) combining data from multiple sources, possibly from multiple different organizations, in heterogeneous formats.  For this assignment, our primary goals are to get you comfortable with importing, extracting, saving, and combining data -- largely using `Pandas DataFrames` as the basic abstraction.  You’ll read data from files, address issues with missing values, save the data in a database, combine the data, and generate visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Task*     \n",
    "Most of you likely were on a plane over the summer, and chances are that at least one of your flights got delayed.  Did you ever wonder how well different airlines do?  We’ll answer those questions in this assignment!  (Caveat: with apologies to international travelers, most of the data is only available for US cities and routes!)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Terminology*      \n",
    "We’ll generally use `field`, `column`, and `attribute` interchangeably to mean a named column in a DataFrame.  We’ll also generally assume that `table`, `DataFrame`, and `relation` mean the same thing.\n",

    "See the external document for submission information.  Remember to also do **Homework 1, Part 2** and optionally **Homework 1-Advanced**.\n",

    "*NBGrader Information*      \n",
    "We're using a package called `nbgrader` to grade your assignments using an autograding system. With that, there's a couple things to take note:\n",
    "- If we specify a format, please use it!\n",
    "- Some cells will not be able to be edited - that is totally fine, we'll mark them\n",
    "- You may add/remove cells, but if a cell is marked test cases, please don't change it...just add cells before/after it!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Score Breakdown*\n",
    "Homework 1 has two parts, Part 1 and Part 2, which are each worth 50 points. The Advanced assignment, when released, will be worth an additional portion (ex: Advanced assignments may be graded out of 120 or 125 instead of 100).\n",
    "- Step 1: 21 pts\n",

    "The data you've imported isn't yet perfect....\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nulls**.  You should see for airlines a variety of entries that say “NaN” (not a number), which represents “unknown” or null information.  In fact, if you look closely there are also other values representing “unknown” such as “\\N” and even “-”.  We’ll have to regularize all of this later!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Schemas**.  OK, you’ve loaded the DataFrames.  You can get the schemas -- the names and types of the columns -- of the DataFrames by the `dtypes` property.  Use `airlines_df.dtypes` and `routes_df.dtypes` to take a look at the schemas.  Now compare the types of `routes_df.airline_id` and `airlines_df.airline_id`.  You should see that one is `int64` and the other is `object`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this?  Python automatically infers the types based on what it reads from the CSV files.  Unfortunately, things like “NaN” are actually floating-point (fractional) numbers and “\\N” is a string.  If a column has multiple kinds of values, Python will consider it to be an “object.”  Unfortunately, this will interfere with how we combine tables later, so we need to “clean” the data.  \n",
